### Adding your company

We've added a few restrictions to keep this a high-quality list:

 - **Technology**: A company's primary product or service must be an information technology product or service.
 - **Traction**: A company must either be publicly launched w/ 1k+ users, be the subject of an article in a national publication, or have raised a round of venture capital.
 - **Location**: A company must have the majority of employees working in Ann Arbor or have a branch with a founder and another full time employee here.

If your company meets the above requirements and you'd like to be added to the list, fork the repo, add your html/css (with your brand colors) and submit a pull request.
